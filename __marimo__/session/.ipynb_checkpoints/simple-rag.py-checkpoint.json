The combination of '\n          'increased energy  output, energy expenditure and basal needs over a '\n          'long period of  time can have a major impact on total energy '\n          'expenditure (see  Figure 16.2 \u201cThe Effect of Physical Activity on '\n          'Energy Expenditure\u201d).  The more energy you expend, the more foods '\n          'you are able to  consume while maintaining a healthy weight. Any '\n          'improvement to  metabolic fitness is beneficial and means a '\n          'decrease in the risk for  developing diabetes, or other chronic '\n          'conditions.  One measurement of metabolic fitness is basal '\n          'metabolic rate, or  BMR, which is a measurement of the amount of '\n          'energy required for  the body to maintain its basic functions while '\n          'at rest, i.e. breathing,  heart beats, liver and kidney function, '\n          'and so on. On average, BMR  accounts for between 50 and 70 percent '\n          'of a person\u2019s total daily  energy expenditure. Different factors '\n          'can affect the BMR. For  example, a slender person who is tall has '\n          'more body surface area  and therefore has a higher RMR relative to '\n          'their body mass (weight).  Also, muscle utilizes more energy at '\n          'rest than fat, so a person with  more muscle mass has a higher '\n          'BMR.  A second measurement of metabolic fitness is the number of  '\n          'calories burned during physical activity. The amount of calories  '\n          'burned depends on how much oxygen is delivered to tissues, and  how '\n          'efficiently metabolic reactions consume oxygen and, therefore,  '\n          'expend calories. One of the best estimates of energy expenditure  '\n          'during exercise is how much oxygen a person consumes. Recall that  '\n          'VO2 max is a measure of the maximum cardiorespiratory capacity  to '\n          'deliver oxygen to the body, especially to working muscles during  '\n          'exercise.. Greater VO2 max is indicative of better cardiovascular  '\n          'fitness. In contrast to RMR, VO2 max increases significantly with  '\n          'exercise training due to training adaptations that increase the  '\n          'body\u2019s ability to deliver oxygen to working tissues and an '\n          'increased  capacity of muscles to take up and utilize oxygen.

Imbalances of Potassium Insufficient potassium levels in the body (hypokalemia) can be caused by a low dietary intake of potassium or by high sodium intakes, but more commonly it results from medications that increase water excretion, mainly diuretics. The signs and symptoms of hypokalemia are related to the functions of potassium in nerve cells and consequently skeletal and smooth-muscle contraction. The signs and symptoms include muscle weakness and cramps, respiratory distress, and constipation. Severe potassium depletion can cause the heart to have abnormal contractions and can even be fatal. High levels of potassium in the blood, or hyperkalemia, also affects the heart. It is a silent condition as it often displays no signs or symptoms. Extremely high levels of potassium in the blood disrupt the electrical impulses that stimulate the heart and can cause the heart to stop. Hyperkalemia is usually the result of kidney dysfunction.

There are three classes of macronutrients: carbohydrates,\nlipids, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into cellular energy.\nThe energy from macronutrients comes from their chemical bonds. This chemical\nenergy is converted into cellular energy that is then utilized to perform work,\nallowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of\nfood energy is the calorie. On nutrition food labels the amount given for\n\u201ccalories\u201d is actually equivalent to each calorie multiplied by one thousand. A\nkilocalorie (one thousand calories, denoted with a small \u201cc\u201d) is synonymous with\nthe \u201cCalorie\u201d (with a capital \u201cC\u201d) on nutrition food labels. Water is also a\nmacronutrient in the sense that you require a large amount of it, but unlike the\nother macronutrients, it does not yield calories.

More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water.\nWithout it, nothing could be transported in or out of the body, chemical\nreactions would not occur, organs would not be cushioned, and body temperature\nwould fluctuate widely. On average, an adult consumes just over two liters of\nwater per day from food and drink combined. Since water is so critical for\nlife\u2019s basic processes, the amount of water input and output is supremely\nimportant, a topic we will explore in detail in Chapter 4. Micronutrients\nMicronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are\nstill essential for carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all\nthe essential minerals and vitamins. There are sixteen essential minerals and\nthirteen vitamins (See Table 1.1 \u201cMinerals and Their Major Functions\u201d and Table\n1.2 \u201cVitamins and Their Major Functions\u201d for a complete list and their major\nfunctions). In contrast to carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, micronutrients\nare not sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as\ncofactors or components of enzymes (i.e., coenzymes).\nPage No. : 7\n\n\nScore: 0.6646\nText: \nLearning Objectives By the end of this chapter, you will be able to: \u2022 Describe\nbasic concepts in nutrition \u2022 Describe factors that affect your nutritional\nneeds \u2022 Describe the importance of research and scientific methods to\nunderstanding nutrition What are Nutrients? The foods we eat contain nutrients.\nNutrients are substances required by the body to perform its basic functions.\nNutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not\nsynthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions:\nthey provide energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical\nprocesses in the body. These basic functions allow us to detect and respond to\nenvironmental surroundings, move, excrete wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and\nreproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for the body to function\nand maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, water,\nvitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful\n(such as natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and\npreservatives) or beneficial (such as antioxidants). 4 | Introduction\nPage No. : 3\n\n\nScore: 0.6536\nText: \nVitamins Major Functions Water-soluble Thiamin (B1) Coenzyme, energy metabolism\nassistance Riboflavin (B2 ) Coenzyme, energy metabolism assistance Niacin (B3)\nCoenzyme, energy metabolism assistance Pantothenic acid (B5) Coenzyme, energy\nmetabolism assistance Pyridoxine (B6) Coenzyme, amino acid synthesis assistance\nBiotin (B7) Coenzyme, amino acid and fatty acid metabolism Folate (B9) Coenzyme,\nessential for growth Cobalamin (B12) Coenzyme, red blood cell synthesis C\n(ascorbic acid) Collagen synthesis, antioxidant Fat-soluble A Vision,\nreproduction, immune system function D Bone and teeth health maintenance, immune\nsystem function E Antioxidant, cell membrane protection K Bone and teeth health\nmaintenance, blood clotting Vitamin deficiencies can cause severe health\nproblems and even death.

It is estimated that GERD affects 25 to 35\npercent of the US population. An analysis of several studies published in the\nAugust 2005 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine concludes that GERD is much\nmore prevalent in people who are obese.1 The most common GERD symptom is\nheartburn, but people with GERD may also experience regurgitation (flow of the\nstomach\u2019s acidic contents into the mouth), frequent coughing, and trouble\nswallowing. There are other causative factors of GERD that may be separate from\nor intertwined with obesity. The sphincter that separates the stomach\u2019s internal\ncontents from the esophagus often does not function properly and acidic gastric\ncontents seep upward. Sometimes the peristaltic contractions of the esophagus\nare also sluggish and compromise the clearance of acidic contents. In addition\nto having an unbalanced, high-fat diet, some people with GERD are sensitive to\nparticular foods\u2014chocolate, garlic, spicy foods, fried foods, and tomato-based\nfoods\u2014which worsen symptoms. Drinks containing alcohol or caffeine may also\nworsen GERD symptoms. GERD is diagnosed most often by a history of the frequency\nof recurring symptoms. A more proper diagnosis can be made when a doctor inserts\na small device into the lower esophagus that measures the acidity of the\ncontents during one\u2019s daily activities.\nPage No. : 1076\n\n\nScore: 0.3031\nThe carbon dioxide gas bubbles infiltrate the stretchy gluten, giving bread its\nporosity and tenderness.

They are the primary fuel for our cells and tissues.\n* **Protein:** Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, making enzymes, and producing hormones.\n* **Fat:** Fat provides energy, helps absorb vitamins, and helps to insulate the body.\n\n**Macronutrient Ratios:**\n\n* **Carbohydrates:** Our bodies need around 45-65% of our total calories from carbohydrates.\n* **Protein:** We need around 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\n* **Fat:** We need around 20-30% of our total calories from fat.\n\n**How Macronutrients Work Together:**\n\nMacronutrients work together to provide the body with the energy and building blocks it needs to function properly. For example:\n\n* Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is used by cells for energy.\n* Protein is used to build and repair tissues, produce enzymes, and produce hormones.\n* Fat is used to store energy and help to insulate the body\n\n"

They are the primary fuel for our cells and tissues.\n* **Protein:** Protein is essential for building and repairing tissues, making enzymes, and producing hormones.\n* **Fat:** Fat provides energy, helps absorb vitamins, and helps to insulate the body.\n\n**Macronutrient Ratios:**\n\n* **Carbohydrates:** Our bodies need around 45-65% of our total calories from carbohydrates.\n* **Protein:** We need around 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day.\n* **Fat:** We need around 20-30% of our total calories from fat.\n\n**How Macronutrients Work Together:**\n\nMacronutrients work together to provide the body with the energy and building blocks it needs to function properly. For example:\n\n* Carbohydrates are broken down into glucose, which is used by cells for energy.\n* Protein is used to build and repair tissues, produce enzymes, and produce hormones.\n* Fat is used to store energy and help to insulate the body\n"

These vitamins are absorbed along with fats in the diet and can be \nstored in the body's fatty tissue and liver for later use. Vitamin A is \nimportant for vision, immune function, and skin health. Vitamin D plays a \ncritical role in calcium absorption and bone health. Vitamin E acts as an \nantioxidant, protecting cells from damage. Vitamin K is essential for blood \nclotting and bone metabolism.\n\nExample 2:\nQuery: What are the causes of type 2 diabetes?\nAnswer: Type 2 diabetes is often associated with overnutrition, particularly \nthe overconsumption of calories leading to obesity. Factors include a diet high\n in refined sugars and saturated fats, which can lead to insulin resistance, a \ncondition where the body's cells do not respond effectively to insulin. Over \ntime, the pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to manage blood sugar levels, \nresulting in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, excessive caloric intake without \nsufficient physical activity exacerbates the risk by promoting weight gain and \nfat accumulation, particularly around the abdomen, further contributing to \ninsulin resistance.\n\nExample 3:\nQuery: What is the importance of hydration for physical performance?\nAnswer: Hydration is crucial for physical performance because water plays key \nroles in maintaining blood volume, regulating body temperature, and ensuring \nthe transport of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Adequate hydration is essential\n for optimal muscle function, endurance, and recovery. Dehydration can lead to \ndecreased performance, fatigue, and increased risk of heat-related illnesses, \nsuch as heat stroke. Drinking sufficient water before, during, and after \nexercise helps ensure peak physical performance and recovery.\n\nNow use the following context items to answer the user query:\n- all other organ systems in the human body.

Smelling food sends a message to your brain.\n Your brain then tells the mouth to get ready, and you start to salivate in \npreparation for a meal. Once you have eaten, your digestive system (Figure 2.4 \n\u201cThe Human Digestive System\u201d) starts the process that breaks down the \ncomponents of food into smaller components that can be absorbed and taken into \nthe body. To do this, the digestive system functions on two levels, \nmechanically to move and mix ingested food and chemically to break down large \nmolecules. The smaller nutrient molecules can then be absorbed and processed by\n cells throughout the body for energy\u00a0 or used as building blocks for new \ncells. The digestive system is one of the eleven organ systems of the human \nbody, and it is composed of several hollow tube-shaped organs including the \nmouth, pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine (colon), \nrectum, and anus. It is lined with mucosal tissue that secretes digestive \njuices (which aid in the breakdown of food) and mucus (which facilitates the \npropulsion of food through the tract).\n- An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the \ntext.
