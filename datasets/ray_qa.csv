How do you define a remote function in Ray?,By decorating a function with @ray.remote and calling it with .remote().
What is ray.get() used for?,ray.get() retrieves the result of a Ray object reference (ObjectRef).
What is ray.put() used for?,ray.put() stores an object in the object store and returns an ObjectRef.
How do you run a Ray cluster on Kubernetes?,"You can use KubeRay, which provides Kubernetes operators and CRDs for managing Ray clusters."
What is the purpose of ray.wait()?,ray.wait() waits for a list of ObjectRefs and returns when the specified number are ready.
How do you monitor Ray applications?,"You can use the Ray Dashboard, which provides a web UI for monitoring Ray clusters and applications."
What is the Ray Dashboard?,The Ray Dashboard is a web-based UI for monitoring and managing Ray clusters.
How do you define resources for a Ray task?,"You can specify resources in the @ray.remote decorator, e.g., @ray.remote(num_cpus=2)."
What is object spilling in Ray?,Object spilling is the process of moving objects from memory to disk when the object store is full.
How do you configure object spilling?,You can configure object spilling by setting the object_spilling_config parameter in ray.init().
What is Ray Data?,"Ray Data is a library for distributed data processing, optimized for machine learning workloads."
How do you create a Ray Dataset?,"You can create a Ray Dataset using ray.data.from_items() or by reading from files using ray.data.read_csv(), etc."
What is the purpose of ray.shutdown()?,ray.shutdown() disconnects the driver from the Ray cluster and cleans up resources.
How do you define a Ray actor class?,By decorating a class with @ray.remote and instantiating it with .remote().
What is the difference between tasks and actors in Ray?,"Tasks are stateless functions, while actors are stateful and maintain internal state across method calls."
How do you pass large objects to Ray tasks?,Use ray.put() to store the object in the object store and pass the ObjectRef to the task.
What is the purpose of Placement Groups in Ray?,Placement Groups allow you to control the placement of tasks and actors on specific resources or nodes.
How do you define a Placement Group?,Use ray.util.placement_group() to define a Placement Group with specified resource bundles.
What is Ray Train?,Ray Train is a library for distributed training of machine learning models using popular frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
How do you use Ray Train with PyTorch?,Define a training function and use TorchTrainer from ray.train.torch to run distributed training.
What is the purpose of ScalingConfig in Ray Train?,"ScalingConfig specifies the number of workers, use of GPUs, and other scaling parameters for training."
How do you perform hyperparameter tuning with Ray Tune?,Define a training function and use tune.Tuner with a search space and TuneConfig to run experiments.
What is ASHA in Ray Tune?,ASHA (Asynchronous Successive Halving Algorithm) is a scheduler for early stopping of unpromising trials.
How do you define a search space in Ray Tune?,"Use the param_space parameter in tune.Tuner with tune.choice(), tune.uniform(), etc."
What is the purpose of session.report() in Ray Tune?,session.report() is used to report metrics during training for Ray Tune to monitor and make scheduling decisions.
How do you resume a Ray Tune experiment?,Use the resume parameter in tune.Tuner to resume from a previous experiment checkpoint.
What is the Ray Job API?,The Ray Job API allows you to submit and manage jobs on a Ray cluster programmatically.
How do you submit a job using the Ray Job CLI?,Use the command ray job submit --address <cluster_address> -- python script.py.
What is the purpose of ray.get_actor()?,ray.get_actor() retrieves a named actor by its name from the Ray cluster.
How do you name a Ray actor?,"Pass the name parameter when creating the actor, e.g., MyActor.options(name='my_actor').remote()."
What is the difference between ray.get() and ray.wait()?,"ray.get() blocks until all results are ready, while ray.wait() returns as soon as the specified number of results are ready."
How do you handle exceptions in Ray tasks?,Exceptions raised in tasks are propagated to the driver when you call ray.get().
What is the purpose of ray.remote() decorator?,ray.remote() marks a function or class for remote execution in the Ray cluster.
How do you specify custom resources for a task?,"Use the resources parameter in @ray.remote, e.g., @ray.remote(resources={'Custom': 1})."
What is the Ray Object Store?,The Ray Object Store is a shared-memory object store that holds objects for fast access across tasks and actors.
How do you debug memory issues in Ray?,Use ray memory and ray dashboard to inspect object references and memory usage.
What is the purpose of ray.timeline()?,ray.timeline() generates a Chrome tracing timeline for profiling Ray applications.
How do you enable Ray usage stats collection?,Use the command ray enable-usage-stats.
How do you disable Ray usage stats collection?,Use the command ray disable-usage-stats.
What is the Ray State API?,"The Ray State API provides programmatic access to the state of the Ray cluster, including tasks, actors, and objects."
How do you access the Ray State API?,"Use ray.state.actors(), ray.state.tasks(), etc., to access cluster state information."
What is the purpose of ray.kill()?,ray.kill() terminates a running actor or task.
How do you handle actor failures in Ray?,Ray automatically restarts actors by default; you can customize this behavior using the max_restarts parameter.
