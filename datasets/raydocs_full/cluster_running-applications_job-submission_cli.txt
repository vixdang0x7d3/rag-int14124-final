This section contains commands for Ray Job Submission.

ray job submit#
Submits a job to be run on the cluster.
By default (if –no-wait is not set), streams logs to stdout until the job finishes.
If the job succeeded, exits with 0. If it failed, exits with 1.

Example:ray job submit -- python my_script.py --arg=val


ray job submit [OPTIONS] ENTRYPOINT...


Options


--address <address>#
Address of the Ray cluster to connect to. Can also be specified using the RAY_ADDRESS environment variable.



--job-id <job_id>#
DEPRECATED: Use --submission-id instead.



--submission-id <submission_id>#
Submission ID to specify for the job. If not provided, one will be generated.



--runtime-env <runtime_env>#
Path to a local YAML file containing a runtime_env definition.



--runtime-env-json <runtime_env_json>#
JSON-serialized runtime_env dictionary.



--working-dir <working_dir>#
Directory containing files that your job will run in. Can be a local directory or a remote URI to a .zip file (S3, GS, HTTP). If specified, this overrides the option in --runtime-env.



--metadata-json <metadata_json>#
JSON-serialized dictionary of metadata to attach to the job.



--entrypoint-num-cpus <entrypoint_num_cpus>#
the quantity of CPU cores to reserve for the entrypoint command, separately from any tasks or actors that are launched by it



--entrypoint-num-gpus <entrypoint_num_gpus>#
the quantity of GPUs to reserve for the entrypoint command, separately from any tasks or actors that are launched by it



--entrypoint-memory <entrypoint_memory>#
the amount of memory to reserve for the entrypoint command, separately from any tasks or actors that are launched by it



--entrypoint-resources <entrypoint_resources>#
a JSON-serialized dictionary mapping resource name to resource quantity describing resources to reserve for the entrypoint command, separately from any tasks or actors that are launched by it



--no-wait#
If set, will not stream logs and wait for the job to exit.



--verify <verify>#
Boolean indication to verify the server’s TLS certificate or a path to a file or directory of trusted certificates.

Default:
True





--headers <headers>#
Used to pass headers through http/s to the Ray Cluster.please follow JSON formatting formatting {“key”: “value”}



--log-style <log_style>#
If ‘pretty’, outputs with formatting and color. If ‘record’, outputs record-style without formatting. ‘auto’ defaults to ‘pretty’, and disables pretty logging if stdin is not a TTY.

Options:
auto | record | pretty





--log-color <log_color>#
Use color logging. Auto enables color logging if stdout is a TTY.

Options:
auto | false | true





-v, --verbose#

Arguments


ENTRYPOINT#
Required argument(s)



Warning
When using the CLI, do not wrap the entrypoint command in quotes.  For example, use
ray job submit --working-dir="." -- python script.py instead of ray job submit --working-dir="." -- "python script.py".
Otherwise you may encounter the error /bin/sh: 1: python script.py: not found.


Warning
You must provide the entrypoint command, python script.py, last (after the --), and any other arguments to ray job submit (e.g., --working-dir=".") must be provided before the  two hyphens (--).
For example, use ray job submit --working-dir="." -- python script.py instead of ray job submit -- python script.py --working-dir=".".
This syntax supports the use of -- to separate arguments to ray job submit from arguments to the entrypoint command.
