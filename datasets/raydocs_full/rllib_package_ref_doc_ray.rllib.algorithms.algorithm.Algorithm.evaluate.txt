Algorithm.evaluate(parallel_train_future: ThreadPoolExecutor | None = None) → Dict[source]#
Evaluates current policy under evaluation_config settings.

Parameters:
parallel_train_future – In case, we are training and avaluating in parallel,
this arg carries the currently running ThreadPoolExecutor object that
runs the training iteration. Use parallel_train_future.done() to
check, whether the parallel training job has completed and
parallel_train_future.result() to get its return values.

Returns:
A ResultDict only containing the evaluation results from the current
iteration.
