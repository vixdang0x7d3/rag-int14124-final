Most KubeRay documentation examples only require a local Kubernetes cluster such as Kind.
Some KubeRay examples require GPU nodes, which can be provided by a managed Kubernetes service.
We collect a few helpful links for users who are getting started with a managed Kubernetes service to launch a Kubernetes cluster equipped with GPUs.
