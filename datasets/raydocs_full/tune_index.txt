Tune is a Python library for experiment execution and hyperparameter tuning at any scale.
You can tune your favorite machine learning framework (PyTorch, XGBoost, TensorFlow and Keras, and more) by running state of the art algorithms such as Population Based Training (PBT) and HyperBand/ASHA.
Tune further integrates with a wide range of additional hyperparameter optimization tools, including Ax, BayesOpt, BOHB, Nevergrad, and Optuna.

Quickstart
To run this example, install the following: pip install "ray[tune]".
In this quick-start example you minimize a simple function of the form f(x) = a**2 + b, our objective function.
The closer a is to zero and the smaller b is, the smaller the total value of f(x).
We will define a so-called search space for  a and b and let Ray Tune explore the space for good values.
from ray import tune


def objective(config):  # ①
    score = config["a"] ** 2 + config["b"]
    return {"score": score}


search_space = {  # ②
    "a": tune.grid_search([0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0]),
    "b": tune.choice([1, 2, 3]),
}

tuner = tune.Tuner(objective, param_space=search_space)  # ③

results = tuner.fit()
print(results.get_best_result(metric="score", mode="min").config)


① Define an objective function.
② Define a search space.
③ Start a Tune run and print the best result.



Keras+Hyperopt
To tune your Keras models with Hyperopt, you wrap your model in an objective function whose config you
can access for selecting hyperparameters.
In the example below we only tune the activation parameter of the first layer of the model, but you can
tune any parameter of the model you want.
After defining the search space, you can simply initialize the HyperOptSearch object and pass it to run.
It’s important to tell Ray Tune which metric you want to optimize and whether you want to maximize or minimize it.
from ray import tune
from ray.tune.search.hyperopt import HyperOptSearch
import keras


def objective(config):  # ①
    model = keras.models.Sequential()
    model.add(keras.layers.Dense(784, activation=config["activation"]))
    model.add(keras.layers.Dense(10, activation="softmax"))

    model.compile(loss="binary_crossentropy", optimizer="adam", metrics=["accuracy"])
    # model.fit(...)
    # loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(...)
    return {"accuracy": accuracy}


search_space = {"activation": tune.choice(["relu", "tanh"])}  # ②
algo = HyperOptSearch()

tuner = tune.Tuner(  # ③
    objective,
    tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(
        metric="accuracy",
        mode="max",
        search_alg=algo,
    ),
    param_space=search_space,
)
results = tuner.fit()


① Wrap a Keras model in an objective function.
② Define a search space and initialize the search algorithm.
③ Start a Tune run that maximizes accuracy.



PyTorch+Optuna
To tune your PyTorch models with Optuna, you wrap your model in an objective function whose config you
can access for selecting hyperparameters.
In the example below we only tune the momentum and learning rate (lr) parameters of the model’s optimizer,
but you can tune any other model parameter you want.
After defining the search space, you can simply initialize the OptunaSearch object and pass it to run.
It’s important to tell Ray Tune which metric you want to optimize and whether you want to maximize or minimize it.
We stop tuning this training run after 5 iterations, but you can easily define other stopping rules as well.
import torch
from ray import tune
from ray.tune.search.optuna import OptunaSearch


def objective(config):  # ①
    train_loader, test_loader = load_data()  # Load some data
    model = ConvNet().to("cpu")  # Create a PyTorch conv net
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(  # Tune the optimizer
        model.parameters(), lr=config["lr"], momentum=config["momentum"]
    )

    while True:
        train_epoch(model, optimizer, train_loader)  # Train the model
        acc = test(model, test_loader)  # Compute test accuracy
        tune.report({"mean_accuracy": acc})  # Report to Tune


search_space = {"lr": tune.loguniform(1e-4, 1e-2), "momentum": tune.uniform(0.1, 0.9)}
algo = OptunaSearch()  # ②

tuner = tune.Tuner(  # ③
    objective,
    tune_config=tune.TuneConfig(
        metric="mean_accuracy",
        mode="max",
        search_alg=algo,
    ),
    run_config=tune.RunConfig(
        stop={"training_iteration": 5},
    ),
    param_space=search_space,
)
results = tuner.fit()
print("Best config is:", results.get_best_result().config)


① Wrap a PyTorch model in an objective function.
② Define a search space and initialize the search algorithm.
③ Start a Tune run that maximizes mean accuracy and stops after 5 iterations.


With Tune you can also launch a multi-node distributed hyperparameter sweep
in less than 10 lines of code.
And you can move your models from training to serving on the same infrastructure with Ray Serve.

Why choose Tune?#
There are many other hyperparameter optimization libraries out there.
If you’re new to Tune, you’re probably wondering, “what makes Tune different?”


Cutting-Edge Optimization Algorithms




As a user, you’re probably looking into hyperparameter optimization because you want to quickly increase your
model performance.
Tune enables you to leverage a variety of these cutting edge optimization algorithms, reducing the cost of tuning
by terminating bad runs early,
choosing better parameters to evaluate, or even
changing the hyperparameters during training to optimize schedules.



First-class Developer Productivity




A key problem with many hyperparameter optimization frameworks is the need to restructure
your code to fit the framework.
With Tune, you can optimize your model just by adding a few code snippets.
Also, Tune removes boilerplate from your code training workflow,
supporting multiple storage options for experiment results (NFS, cloud storage) and
logs results to tools such as MLflow and TensorBoard, while also being highly customizable.



Multi-GPU & Distributed Training Out Of The Box




Hyperparameter tuning is known to be highly time-consuming, so it is often necessary to parallelize this process.
Most other tuning frameworks require you to implement your own multi-process framework or build your own
distributed system to speed up hyperparameter tuning.
However, Tune allows you to transparently parallelize across multiple GPUs and multiple nodes.
Tune even has seamless fault tolerance and cloud support, allowing you to scale up
your hyperparameter search by 100x while reducing costs by up to 10x by using cheap preemptible instances.



Coming From Another Hyperparameter Optimization Tool?




You might be already using an existing hyperparameter tuning tool such as HyperOpt or Bayesian Optimization.
In this situation, Tune actually allows you to power up your existing workflow.
Tune’s Search Algorithms integrate with a variety of popular hyperparameter tuning
libraries (see examples) and allow you to seamlessly scale up your optimization
process - without sacrificing performance.
