AlgorithmConfig.get_rollout_fragment_length(worker_index: int = 0) → int[source]#
Automatically infers a proper rollout_fragment_length setting if “auto”.
Uses the simple formula:
rollout_fragment_length = total_train_batch_size /
(num_envs_per_env_runner * num_env_runners)
If result is a fraction AND worker_index is provided, makes
those workers add additional timesteps, such that the overall batch size (across
the workers) adds up to exactly the total_train_batch_size.

Returns:
The user-provided rollout_fragment_length or a computed one (if user
provided value is “auto”), making sure total_train_batch_size is reached
exactly in each iteration.
