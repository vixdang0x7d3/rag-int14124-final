ReplayBuffer.sample(num_items: int | None = None, **kwargs) → SampleBatch | MultiAgentBatch | Dict[str, Any] | None[source]#
Samples num_items items from this buffer.
The items depend on the buffer’s storage_unit.
Samples in the results may be repeated.
Examples for sampling results:
1) If storage unit ‘timesteps’ has been chosen and batches of
size 5 have been added, sample(5) will yield a concatenated batch of
15 timesteps.
2) If storage unit ‘sequences’ has been chosen and sequences of
different lengths have been added, sample(5) will yield a concatenated
batch with a number of timesteps equal to the sum of timesteps in
the 5 sampled sequences.
3) If storage unit ‘episodes’ has been chosen and episodes of
different lengths have been added, sample(5) will yield a concatenated
batch with a number of timesteps equal to the sum of timesteps in
the 5 sampled episodes.

Parameters:

num_items – Number of items to sample from this buffer.
**kwargs – Forward compatibility kwargs.


Returns:
Concatenated batch of items.
