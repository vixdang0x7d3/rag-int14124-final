Algorithm.train()#
Runs one logical iteration of training.
Calls step() internally. Subclasses should override step()
instead to return results.
This method automatically fills the following fields in the result:

done (bool): training is terminated. Filled only if not provided.
time_this_iter_s (float): Time in seconds this iteration
took to run. This may be overridden in order to override the
system-computed time difference.
time_total_s (float): Accumulated time in seconds for this
entire experiment.
training_iteration (int): The index of this
training iteration, e.g. call to train(). This is incremented
after step() is called.
pid (str): The pid of the training process.
date (str): A formatted date of when the result was processed.
timestamp (str): A UNIX timestamp of when the result
was processed. This may be overridden.
hostname (str): Hostname of the machine hosting the training
process.
node_ip (str): Node ip of the machine hosting the training
process.


Returns:
A dict that describes training progress.
