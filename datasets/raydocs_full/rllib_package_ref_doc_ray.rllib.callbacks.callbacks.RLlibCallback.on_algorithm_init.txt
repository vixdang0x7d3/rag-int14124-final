RLlibCallback.on_algorithm_init(*, algorithm: Algorithm, metrics_logger: MetricsLogger | None = None, **kwargs) → None[source]#
Callback run when a new Algorithm instance has finished setup.
This method gets called at the end of Algorithm.setup() after all
the initialization is done, and before actually training starts.

Parameters:

algorithm – Reference to the Algorithm instance.
metrics_logger – The MetricsLogger object inside the Algorithm. Can be
used to log custom metrics after algo initialization.
kwargs – Forward compatibility placeholder.
