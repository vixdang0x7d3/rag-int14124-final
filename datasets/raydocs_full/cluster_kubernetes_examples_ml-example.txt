Note
To learn the basics of Ray on Kubernetes, we recommend taking a look
at the introductory guide first.

In this guide, we show you how to run a sample Ray machine learning
workload on Kubernetes infrastructure.
We will run Ray’s XGBoost training benchmark with a 100 gigabyte training set.
To learn more about using Ray’s XGBoostTrainer, check out the XGBoostTrainer documentation.

Kubernetes infrastructure setup on GCP#
This document provides instructions for GCP to create a Kubernetes cluster, but a similar setup would work for any major cloud provider.
Check out the introductory guide if you want to set up a Kubernetes cluster on other cloud providers.
If you have an existing Kubernetes cluster, you can ignore this step.
# Set up a cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
gcloud container clusters create autoscaler-ray-cluster \
    --num-nodes=10 --zone=us-central1-c --machine-type e2-standard-16 --disk-size 1000GB

# (Optional) Set up a cluster with autopilot on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
# The following command creates an autoscaling node pool with a 1 node minimum and a 10 node maximum.
# The 1 static node will be used to run the Ray head pod. This node may also host the KubeRay
# operator and Kubernetes system components. After the workload is submitted, 9 additional nodes will
# scale up to accommodate Ray worker pods. These nodes will scale back down after the workload is complete.
gcloud container clusters create autoscaler-ray-cluster \
    --num-nodes=1 --min-nodes 1 --max-nodes 10 --enable-autoscaling \
    --zone=us-central1-c --machine-type e2-standard-16 --disk-size 1000GB


Make sure you are connected to your Kubernetes cluster. For GCP, you can do so by:

Navigate to your GKE cluster page, and click “CONNECT” button. Then, copy “Command-line access”.
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <your-cluster-name> --region <your-region> --project <your-project> (Link)
kubectl config use-context (Link)

For the workload in this guide, it is recommended to use a pool or group of Kubernetes nodes
with the following properties:

10 nodes total
A capacity of 16 CPU and 64 Gi memory per node. For the major cloud providers, suitable instance types include

m5.4xlarge (Amazon Web Services)
Standard_D5_v2 (Azure)
e2-standard-16 (Google Cloud)


Each node should be configured with 1000 gigabytes of disk space (to store the training set).



Deploy the KubeRay operator#
Once you have set up your Kubernetes cluster, deploy the KubeRay operator.
Refer to the Getting Started guide
for instructions on this step.


Deploy a Ray cluster#
Now we’re ready to deploy the Ray cluster that will execute our workload.

Tip
The Ray cluster we’ll deploy is configured such that one Ray pod will be scheduled
per 16-CPU Kubernetes node. The pattern of one Ray pod per Kubernetes node is encouraged, but not required.
Broadly speaking, it is more efficient to use a few large Ray pods than many small ones.

We recommend taking a look at the config file applied in the following command.
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/ray/releases/2.0.0/doc/source/cluster/kubernetes/configs/xgboost-benchmark.yaml


A Ray head pod and 9 Ray worker pods will be created.

Optional: Deploying an autoscaling Ray cluster
If you’ve set up an autoscaling node group or pool, you may wish to deploy
an autoscaling cluster by applying the config xgboost-benchmark-autoscaler.yaml.
One Ray head pod will be created. Once the workload starts, the Ray autoscaler will trigger
creation of Ray worker pods. Kubernetes autoscaling will then create nodes to place the Ray pods.



Run the workload#
To observe the startup progress of the Ray head pod, run the following command.
# If you're on MacOS, first `brew install watch`.
watch -n 1 kubectl get pod


Once the Ray head pod enters Running state, we are ready to execute the XGBoost workload.
We will use Ray Job Submission to kick off the workload.

Connect to the cluster.#
We use port-forwarding in this guide as a simple way to experiment with a Ray cluster’s services.
See the networking notes for production use-cases.
# Run the following blocking command in a separate shell.
kubectl port-forward service/raycluster-xgboost-benchmark-head-svc 8265:8265




Submit the workload.#
We’ll use the Ray Job Python SDK to submit the XGBoost workload.
from ray.job_submission import JobSubmissionClient

client = JobSubmissionClient("http://127.0.0.1:8265")

kick_off_xgboost_benchmark = (
    # Clone ray. If ray is already present, don't clone again.
    "git clone https://github.com/ray-project/ray || true; "
    # Run the benchmark.
    "python ray/release/train_tests/xgboost_lightgbm/train_batch_inference_benchmark.py"
    " xgboost --size=100G --disable-check"
)


submission_id = client.submit_job(
    entrypoint=kick_off_xgboost_benchmark,
)

print("Use the following command to follow this Job's logs:")
print(f"ray job logs '{submission_id}' --follow")


To submit the workload, run the above Python script.
The script is available in the Ray repository.
# Download the above script.
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ray-project/ray/releases/2.0.0/doc/source/cluster/doc_code/xgboost_submit.py -o xgboost_submit.py
# Run the script.
python xgboost_submit.py




Observe progress.#
The benchmark may take up to 60 minutes to run.
Use the following tools to observe its progress.

Job logs#
To follow the job’s logs, use the command printed by the above submission script.
# Substitute the Ray Job's submission id.
ray job logs 'raysubmit_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' --follow --address http://127.0.0.1:8265




Kubectl#
Observe the pods in your cluster with
# If you're on MacOS, first `brew install watch`.
watch -n 1 kubectl get pod




Ray Dashboard#
View localhost:8265 in your browser to access the Ray Dashboard.


Ray Status#
Observe autoscaling status and Ray resource usage with
# Substitute the name of your Ray cluster's head pod.
watch -n 1 kubectl exec -it raycluster-xgboost-benchmark-head-xxxxx -- ray status



Note
Under some circumstances and for certain cloud providers,
the K8s API server may become briefly unavailable during Kubernetes
cluster resizing events.
Don’t worry if that happens – the Ray workload should be uninterrupted.
For the example in this guide, wait until the API server is back up, restart the port-forwarding process,
and re-run the job log command.




Job completion#

Benchmark results#
Once the benchmark is complete, the job log will display the results:
Results: {'training_time': 1338.488839321999, 'prediction_time': 403.36653568099973}


The performance of the benchmark is sensitive to the underlying cloud infrastructure –
you might not match the numbers quoted in the benchmark docs.


Model parameters#
The file model.json in the Ray head pod contains the parameters for the trained model.
Other result data will be available in the directory ray_results in the head pod.
Refer to the the XGBoostTrainer documentation for details.

Scale-down
If autoscaling is enabled, Ray worker pods will scale down after 60 seconds.
After the Ray worker pods are gone, your Kubernetes infrastructure should scale down
the nodes that hosted these pods.



Clean-up#
Delete your Ray cluster with the following command:
kubectl delete raycluster raycluster-xgboost-benchmark


If you’re on a public cloud, don’t forget to clean up the underlying
node group and/or Kubernetes cluster.
