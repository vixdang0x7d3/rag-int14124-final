Guide: end-to-end fault tolerance for your Serve app#
Serve provides some fault tolerance features out of the box. Two options to get end-to-end fault tolerance are the following:

tune these features and run Serve on top of KubeRay
use the Anyscale platform, a managed Ray platform


Replica health-checking#
By default, the Serve controller periodically health-checks each Serve deployment replica and restarts it on failure.
You can define custom application-level health-checks and adjust their frequency and timeout.
To define a custom health-check, add a check_health method to your deployment class.
This method should take no arguments and return no result, and it should raise an exception if Ray Serve considers the replica unhealthy.
If the health-check fails, the Serve controller logs the exception, kills the unhealthy replica(s), and restarts them.
You can also use the deployment options to customize how frequently Serve runs the health-check and the timeout after which Serve marks a replica unhealthy.
@serve.deployment(health_check_period_s=10, health_check_timeout_s=30)
class MyDeployment:
    def __init__(self, db_addr: str):
        self._my_db_connection = connect_to_db(db_addr)

    def __call__(self, request):
        return self._do_something_cool()

    # Called by Serve to check the replica's health.
    def check_health(self):
        if not self._my_db_connection.is_connected():
            # The specific type of exception is not important.
            raise RuntimeError("uh-oh, DB connection is broken.")




Worker node recovery#

KubeRay Required
You must deploy your Serve application with KubeRay to use this feature.
See Serve’s Kubernetes production guide to learn how you can deploy your app with KubeRay.

By default, Serve can recover from certain failures, such as unhealthy actors. When Serve runs on Kubernetes with KubeRay, it can also recover from some cluster-level failures, such as dead workers or head nodes.
When a worker node fails, the actors running on it also fail. Serve detects that the actors have failed, and it attempts to respawn the actors on the remaining, healthy nodes. Meanwhile, KubeRay detects that the node itself has failed, so it attempts to restart the worker pod on another running node, and it also brings up a new healthy node to replace it. Once the node comes up, if the pod is still pending, it can be restarted on that node. Similarly, Serve can also respawn any pending actors on that node as well. The deployment replicas running on healthy nodes can continue serving traffic throughout the recovery period.


Head node recovery: Ray GCS fault tolerance#

KubeRay Required
You must deploy your Serve application with KubeRay to use this feature.
See Serve’s Kubernetes production guide to learn how you can deploy your app with KubeRay.

In this section, you’ll learn how to add fault tolerance to Ray’s Global Control Store (GCS), which allows your Serve application to serve traffic even when the head node crashes.
By default, the Ray head node is a single point of failure: if it crashes, the entire Ray cluster crashes and you must restart it. When running on Kubernetes, the RayService controller health-checks the Ray cluster and restarts it if this occurs, but this introduces some downtime.
Starting with Ray 2.0+, KubeRay supports Global Control Store (GCS) fault tolerance, preventing the Ray cluster from crashing if the head node goes down.
While the head node is recovering, Serve applications can still handle traffic with worker nodes but you can’t update or recover from other failures like Actors or Worker nodes crashing.
Once the GCS recovers, the cluster returns to normal behavior.
You can enable GCS fault tolerance on KubeRay by adding an external Redis server and modifying your RayService Kubernetes object with the following steps:

Step 1: Add external Redis server#
GCS fault tolerance requires an external Redis database. You can choose to host your own Redis database, or you can use one through a third-party vendor. Use a highly available Redis database for resiliency.
For development purposes, you can also host a small Redis database on the same Kubernetes cluster as your Ray cluster. For example, you can add a 1-node Redis cluster by prepending these three Redis objects to your Kubernetes YAML:
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: redis-config
  labels:
    app: redis
data:
  redis.conf: |-
    port 6379
    bind 0.0.0.0
    protected-mode no
    requirepass 5241590000000000
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis
  labels:
    app: redis
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - name: redis
      port: 6379
  selector:
    app: redis
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis
  labels:
    app: redis
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: redis
          image: redis:5.0.8
          command:
            - "sh"
            - "-c"
            - "redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 6379
          volumeMounts:
            - name: config
              mountPath: /usr/local/etc/redis/redis.conf
              subPath: redis.conf
      volumes:
        - name: config
          configMap:
            name: redis-config
---


This configuration is NOT production-ready, but it’s useful for development and testing. When you move to production, it’s highly recommended that you replace this 1-node Redis cluster with a highly available Redis cluster.


Step 2: Add Redis info to RayService#
After adding the Redis objects, you also need to modify the RayService configuration.
First, you need to update your RayService metadata’s annotations:



Vanilla Config
...
apiVersion: ray.io/v1alpha1
kind: RayService
metadata:
  name: rayservice-sample
spec:
...





Fault Tolerant Config
...
apiVersion: ray.io/v1alpha1
kind: RayService
metadata:
  name: rayservice-sample
  annotations:
    ray.io/ft-enabled: "true"
    ray.io/external-storage-namespace: "my-raycluster-storage-namespace"
spec:
...




The annotations are:

ray.io/ft-enabled REQUIRED: Enables GCS fault tolerance when true
ray.io/external-storage-namespace OPTIONAL: Sets the external storage namespace

Next, you need to add the RAY_REDIS_ADDRESS environment variable to the headGroupSpec:



Vanilla Config
apiVersion: ray.io/v1alpha1
kind: RayService
metadata:
    ...
spec:
    ...
    rayClusterConfig:
        headGroupSpec:
            ...
            template:
                ...
                spec:
                    ...
                    env:
                        ...





Fault Tolerant Config
apiVersion: ray.io/v1alpha1
kind: RayService
metadata:
    ...
spec:
    ...
    rayClusterConfig:
        headGroupSpec:
            ...
            template:
                ...
                spec:
                    ...
                    env:
                        ...
                        - name: RAY_REDIS_ADDRESS
                          value: redis:6379




RAY_REDIS_ADDRESS’s value should be your Redis database’s redis:// address. It should contain your Redis database’s host and port. An example Redis address is redis://user:secret@localhost:6379/0?foo=bar&qux=baz.
In the example above, the Redis deployment name (redis) is the host within the Kubernetes cluster, and the Redis port is 6379. The example is compatible with the previous section’s example config.
After you apply the Redis objects along with your updated RayService, your Ray cluster can recover from head node crashes without restarting all the workers!

Spreading replicas across nodes#
One way to improve the availability of your Serve application is to spread deployment replicas across multiple nodes so that you still have enough running
replicas to serve traffic even after a certain number of node failures.
By default, Serve soft spreads all deployment replicas but it has a few limitations:

The spread is soft and best-effort with no guarantee that the it’s perfectly even.
Serve tries to spread replicas among the existing nodes if possible instead of launching new nodes.
For example, if you have a big enough single node cluster, Serve schedules all replicas on that single node assuming
it has enough resources. However, that node becomes the single point of failure.

You can change the spread behavior of your deployment with the max_replicas_per_node
deployment option, which hard limits the number of replicas of a given deployment that can run on a single node.
If you set it to 1 then you’re effectively strict spreading the deployment replicas. If you don’t set it then there’s no hard spread constraint and Serve uses the default soft spread mentioned in the preceding paragraph. max_replicas_per_node option is per deployment and only affects the spread of replicas within a deployment. There’s no spread between replicas of different deployments.
The following code example shows how to set max_replicas_per_node deployment option:
import ray
from ray import serve

@serve.deployment(max_replicas_per_node=1)
class Deployment1:
  def __call__(self, request):
    return "hello"

@serve.deployment(max_replicas_per_node=2)
class Deployment2:
  def __call__(self, request):
    return "world"


This example has two Serve deployments with different max_replicas_per_node: Deployment1 can have at most one replica on each node and Deployment2 can have at most two replicas on each node. If you schedule two replicas of Deployment1 and two replicas of Deployment2, Serve runs a cluster with at least two nodes, each running one replica of Deployment1. The two replicas of Deployment2 may run on either a single node or across two nodes because either satisfies the max_replicas_per_node constraint.



Serve’s recovery procedures#
This section explains how Serve recovers from system failures. It uses the following Serve application and config as a working example.



Python Code
# File name: sleepy_pid.py

from ray import serve


@serve.deployment
class SleepyPid:
    def __init__(self):
        import time

        time.sleep(10)

    def __call__(self) -> int:
        import os

        return os.getpid()


app = SleepyPid.bind()

Follow the KubeRay quickstart guide to:

Install kubectl and Helm
Prepare a Kubernetes cluster
Deploy a KubeRay operator

Then, deploy the Serve application above:
$ kubectl apply -f config.yaml



Worker node failure#
You can simulate a worker node failure in the working example. First, take a look at the nodes and pods running in your Kubernetes cluster:
$ kubectl get nodes

NAME                                        STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION

gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-m888   Ready    <none>   3d22h   v1.22.12-gke.1200
gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-pu2q   Ready    <none>   3d22h   v1.22.12-gke.1200

$ kubectl get pods -o wide

NAME                                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE    IP           NODE                                        NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES

ervice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-worker-small-group-pztzk   1/1     Running   0               3m3s   10.68.2.61   gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-m888   <none>           <none>
rayservice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-head-28mdh             1/1     Running   1 (2m55s ago)   3m3s   10.68.0.45   gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-pu2q   <none>           <none>
redis-75c8b8b65d-4qgfz                                    1/1     Running   0               3m3s   10.68.2.60   gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-nvm2   <none>           <none>


Open a separate terminal window and port-forward to one of the worker nodes:
$ kubectl port-forward ervice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-worker-small-group-bdv6q 8000
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8000 -> 8000
Forwarding from [::1]:8000 -> 8000


While the port-forward is running, you can query the application in another terminal window:
$ curl localhost:8000
418


The output is the process ID of the deployment replica that handled the request. The application launches 6 deployment replicas, so if you run the query multiple times, you should see different process IDs:
$ curl localhost:8000
418
$ curl localhost:8000
256
$ curl localhost:8000
385


Now you can simulate worker failures. You have two options: kill a worker pod or kill a worker node. Let’s start with the worker pod. Make sure to kill the pod that you’re not port-forwarding to, so you can continue querying the living worker while the other one relaunches.
$ kubectl delete pod ervice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-worker-small-group-pztzk
pod "ervice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-worker-small-group-pztzk" deleted

$ curl localhost:8000
6318


While the pod crashes and recovers, the live pod can continue serving traffic!

Tip
Killing a node and waiting for it to recover usually takes longer than killing a pod and waiting for it to recover. For this type of debugging, it’s quicker to simulate failures by killing at the pod level rather than at the node level.

You can similarly kill a worker node and see that the other nodes can continue serving traffic:
$ kubectl get pods -o wide

$ kubectl delete node gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-m888
node "gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-m888" deleted

$ curl localhost:8000

Head node failure#
You can simulate a head node failure by either killing the head pod or the head node. First, take a look at the running pods in your cluster:
$ kubectl get pods -o wide

NAME                                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE     IP           NODE                                        NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
ervice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-worker-small-group-6f2pk   1/1     Running   0             6m59s   10.68.2.64   gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-nvm2   <none>           <none>
ervice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-worker-small-group-bdv6q   1/1     Running   0             79m     10.68.2.62   gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-nvm2   <none>           <none>
rayservice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-head-28mdh             1/1     Running   1 (79m ago)   79m     10.68.0.45   gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-pu2q   <none>           <none>
redis-75c8b8b65d-4qgfz                                    1/1     Running   0             79m     10.68.2.60   gke-serve-demo-default-pool-ed597cce-nvm2   <none>           <none>


Port-forward to one of your worker pods. Make sure this pod is on a separate node from the head node, so you can kill the head node without crashing the worker:
$ kubectl port-forward ervice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-worker-small-group-bdv6q
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8000 -> 8000
Forwarding from [::1]:8000 -> 8000


In a separate terminal, you can make requests to the Serve application:
$ curl localhost:8000
418


You can kill the head pod to simulate killing the Ray head node:
$ kubectl delete pod rayservice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-head-28mdh
pod "rayservice-sample-raycluster-thwmr-head-28mdh" deleted

$ curl localhost:8000


If you have configured GCS fault tolerance on your cluster, your worker pod can continue serving traffic without restarting when the head pod crashes and recovers. Without GCS fault tolerance, KubeRay restarts all worker pods when the head pod crashes, so you’ll need to wait for the workers to restart and the deployments to reinitialize before you can port-forward and send more requests.


Serve controller failure#
You can simulate a Serve controller failure by manually killing the Serve actor.
If you’re running KubeRay, exec into one of your pods:
$ kubectl get pods

NAME                                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ervice-sample-raycluster-mx5x6-worker-small-group-hfhnw   1/1     Running   0          118m
ervice-sample-raycluster-mx5x6-worker-small-group-nwcpb   1/1     Running   0          118m
rayservice-sample-raycluster-mx5x6-head-bqjhw             1/1     Running   0          118m
redis-75c8b8b65d-4qgfz                                    1/1     Running   0          3h36m

$ kubectl exec -it rayservice-sample-raycluster-mx5x6-head-bqjhw -- bash
ray@rayservice-sample-raycluster-mx5x6-head-bqjhw:~$


You can use the Ray State API to inspect your Serve app:
$ ray summary actors

 0  70a718c973c2ce9471d318f701000000  ServeController  ALIVE    SERVE_CONTROLLER_ACTOR  48570


You can then kill the Serve controller via the Python interpreter. Note that you’ll need to use the NAME from the ray list actor output to get a handle to the Serve controller.
$ python

>>> import ray
>>> controller_handle = ray.get_actor("SERVE_CONTROLLER_ACTOR", namespace="serve")
>>> ray.kill(controller_handle, no_restart=True)
>>> exit()


You can use the Ray State API to check the controller’s status:
$ ray list actors --filter "class_name=ServeController"

You should still be able to query your deployments while the controller is recovering:
# If you're running KubeRay, you
# can do this from inside the pod:

$ python

>>> import requests
>>> requests.get("http://localhost:8000").json()
347



Note
While the controller is dead, replica health-checking and deployment autoscaling will not work. They’ll continue working once the controller recovers.



Deployment replica failure#
You can simulate replica failures by manually killing deployment replicas. If you’re running KubeRay, make sure to exec into a Ray pod before running these commands.

You can use the NAME from the ray list actor output to get a handle to one of the replicas:
$ python

>>> import ray
>>> replica_handle = ray.get_actor("SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP", namespace="serve")

$ python

>>> import requests

Proxy failure#
You can simulate Proxy failures by manually killing ProxyActor actors. If you’re running KubeRay, make sure to exec into a Ray pod before running these commands.

You can use the NAME from the ray list actor output to get a handle to one of the replicas:
$ python

>>> import ray

>>> ray.kill(proxy_handle, no_restart=False)
>>> exit()


While the proxy is restarted, the other proxies can continue accepting requests. Eventually the proxy restarts and continues accepting requests. You can use the ray list actor command to see when the proxy restarts:
$ ray list actors --filter "class_name=ProxyActor"
