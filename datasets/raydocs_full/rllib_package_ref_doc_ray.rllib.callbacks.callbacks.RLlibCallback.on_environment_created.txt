RLlibCallback.on_environment_created(*, env_runner: EnvRunner, metrics_logger: MetricsLogger | None = None, env: gymnasium.Env, env_context: EnvContext, **kwargs) → None[source]#
Callback run when a new environment object has been created.
Note: This only applies to the new API stack. The env used is usually a
gym.Env (or more specifically a gym.vector.Env).

Parameters:

env_runner – Reference to the current EnvRunner instance.
metrics_logger – The MetricsLogger object inside the env_runner. Can be
used to log custom metrics after environment creation.
env – The environment object that has been created on env_runner. This is
usually a gym.Env (or a gym.vector.Env) object.
env_context – The EnvContext object that has been passed to the
gym.make() call as kwargs (and to the gym.Env as config). It should
have all the config key/value pairs in it as well as the
EnvContext-typical properties: worker_index, num_workers, and
remote.
kwargs – Forward compatibility placeholder.
