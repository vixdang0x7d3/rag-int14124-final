ray.rllib.utils.numpy.convert_to_numpy(x: numpy.array | jnp.ndarray | tf.Tensor | torch.Tensor | dict | tuple, reduce_type: bool = True) → numpy.array | jnp.ndarray | tf.Tensor | torch.Tensor | dict | tuple[source]#
Converts values in stats to non-Tensor numpy or python types.

Parameters:

x – Any (possibly nested) struct, the values in which will be
converted and returned as a new struct with all torch/tf tensors
being converted to numpy types.
reduce_type – Whether to automatically reduce all float64 and int64 data
into float32 and int32 data, respectively.


Returns:
A new struct with the same structure as x, but with all
values converted to numpy arrays (on CPU).
