ray.rllib.utils.torch_utils.convert_to_torch_tensor(x, device: str | None = None, pin_memory: bool = False, use_stream: bool = False, stream: torch.cuda.Stream | torch.cuda.classes.Stream | None = None)[source]#
Converts any (possibly nested) structure to torch.Tensors.

Parameters:

x – The input structure whose leaves will be converted.
device – The device to create the tensor on (e.g. “cuda:0” or “cpu”).
pin_memory – If True, calls pin_memory() on the created tensors.
use_stream – If True, uses a separate CUDA stream for Tensor.to().
stream – An optional CUDA stream for the host-to-device copy in Tensor.to().


Returns:
A new structure with the same layout as x but with all leaves converted
to torch.Tensors. Leaves that are None are left unchanged.
