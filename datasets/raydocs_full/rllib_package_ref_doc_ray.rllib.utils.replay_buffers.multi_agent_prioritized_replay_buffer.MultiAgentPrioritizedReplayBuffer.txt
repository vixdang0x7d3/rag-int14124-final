Bases: MultiAgentReplayBuffer, PrioritizedReplayBuffer
A prioritized replay buffer shard for multiagent setups.
This buffer is meant to be run in parallel to distribute experiences
across num_shards shards. Unlike simpler buffers, it holds a set of
buffers - one for each policy ID.
DeveloperAPI: This API may change across minor Ray releases.
