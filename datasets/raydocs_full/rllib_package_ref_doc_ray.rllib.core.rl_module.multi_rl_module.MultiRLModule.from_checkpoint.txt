classmethod MultiRLModule.from_checkpoint(path: str | Path, filesystem: pyarrow.fs.FileSystem | None = None, **kwargs) → Checkpointable#
Creates a new Checkpointable instance from the given location and returns it.

Parameters:

path – The checkpoint path to load (a) the information on how to construct
a new instance of the implementing class and (b) the state to restore
the created instance to.
filesystem – PyArrow FileSystem to use to access data at the path. If not
specified, this is inferred from the URI scheme of path.
kwargs – Forward compatibility kwargs. Note that these kwargs are sent to
each subcomponent’s from_checkpoint() call.


Returns:
A new instance of the implementing class, already set to the state stored
under path.
