class ray.util.dask.RayDaskCallback(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any)[source]#
Bases: Callback
Extends Dask’s Callback class with Ray-specific hooks. When instantiating
or subclassing this class, both the normal Dask hooks (e.g. pretask,
posttask, etc.) and the Ray-specific hooks can be provided.
See dask.callbacks.Callback for usage.
Caveats: Any Dask-Ray scheduler must bring the Ray-specific callbacks into
context using the local_ray_callbacks context manager, since the built-in
local_callbacks context manager provided by Dask isn’t aware of this
class.
