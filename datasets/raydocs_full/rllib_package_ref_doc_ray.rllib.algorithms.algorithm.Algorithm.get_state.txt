Algorithm.get_state(components: str | Collection[str] | None = None, *, not_components: str | Collection[str] | None = None, **kwargs) → Dict[str, Any][source]#
Returns the implementing class’s current state as a dict.
The returned dict must only contain msgpack-serializable data if you want to
use the AlgorithmConfig._msgpack_checkpoints option. Consider returning your
non msgpack-serializable data from the Checkpointable.get_ctor_args_and_kwargs
method, instead.

Parameters:

components – An optional collection of string keys to be included in the
returned state. This might be useful, if getting certain components
of the state is expensive (e.g. reading/compiling the weights of a large
NN) and at the same time, these components are not required by the
caller.
not_components – An optional list of string keys to be excluded in the
returned state, even if the same string is part of components.
This is useful to get the complete state of the class, except
one or a few components.
kwargs – Forward-compatibility kwargs.


Returns:
The current state of the implementing class (or only the components
specified, w/o those in not_components).
