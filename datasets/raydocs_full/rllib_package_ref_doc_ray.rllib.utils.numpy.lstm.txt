ray.rllib.utils.numpy.lstm(x, weights: numpy.ndarray, biases: numpy.ndarray | None = None, initial_internal_states: numpy.ndarray | None = None, time_major: bool = False, forget_bias: float = 1.0)[source]#
Calculates LSTM layer output given weights/biases, states, and input.

Parameters:

x – The inputs to the LSTM layer including time-rank
(0th if time-major, else 1st) and the batch-rank
(1st if time-major, else 0th).
weights – The weights matrix.
biases – The biases vector. All 0s if None.
initial_internal_states – The initial internal
states to pass into the layer. All 0s if None.
time_major – Whether to use time-major or not. Default: False.
forget_bias – Gets added to first sigmoid (forget gate) output.
Default: 1.0.


Returns:
Tuple consisting of 1) The LSTM layer’s output and
2) Tuple: Last (c-state, h-state).
