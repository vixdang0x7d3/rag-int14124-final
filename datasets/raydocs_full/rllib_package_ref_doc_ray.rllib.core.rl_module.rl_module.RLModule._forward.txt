RLModule._forward(batch: Dict[str, Any], **kwargs) → Dict[str, Any][source]#
Generic forward pass method, used in all phases of training and evaluation.
If you need a more nuanced distinction between forward passes in the different
phases of training and evaluation, override the following methods instead:
For distinct action computation logic w/o exploration, override the
self._forward_inference() method.
For distinct action computation logic with exploration, override the
self._forward_exploration() method.
For distinct forward pass logic before loss computation, override the
self._forward_train() method.

Parameters:

batch – The input batch.
**kwargs – Additional keyword arguments.


Returns:
The output of the forward pass.
