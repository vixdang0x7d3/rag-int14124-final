RLlibCallback.on_train_result(*, algorithm: Algorithm, metrics_logger: MetricsLogger | None = None, result: dict, **kwargs) → None[source]#
Called at the end of Algorithm.train().

Parameters:

algorithm – Current Algorithm instance.
metrics_logger – The MetricsLogger object inside the Algorithm. Can be
used to log custom metrics after traing results are available.
result – Dict of results returned from Algorithm.train() call.
You can mutate this object to add additional metrics.
kwargs – Forward compatibility placeholder.
