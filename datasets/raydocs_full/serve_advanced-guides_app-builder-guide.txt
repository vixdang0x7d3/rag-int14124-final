This section describes how to pass arguments to your applications using an application builder function.

Defining an application builder#
When writing an application, there are often parameters that you want to be able to easily change in development or production.
For example, you might have a path to trained model weights and want to test out a newly trained model.
In Ray Serve, these parameters are typically passed to the constructor of your deployments using .bind().
This pattern allows you to be configure deployments using ordinary Python code but it requires modifying the code anytime one of the parameters needs to change.
To pass arguments without changing the code, define an “application builder” function that takes an arguments dictionary (or Pydantic object) and returns the built application to be run.
from typing import Dict

from ray import serve
from ray.serve import Application


@serve.deployment
class HelloWorld:
    def __init__(self, message: str):
        self._message = message
        print("Message:", self._message)

    def __call__(self, request):
        return self._message


def app_builder(args: Dict[str, str]) -> Application:
    return HelloWorld.bind(args["message"])




You can use this application builder function as the import path in the serve run CLI command or the config file (as shown below).
To avoid writing code to handle type conversions and missing arguments, use a Pydantic object instead.

Passing arguments via serve run#
Pass arguments to the application builder from serve run using the following syntax:
$ serve run hello:app_builder key1=val1 key2=val2


The arguments are passed to the application builder as a dictionary, in this case {"key1": "val1", "key2": "val2"}.
For example, to pass a new message to the HelloWorld app defined above (with the code saved in hello.py):
% serve run hello:app_builder message="Hello from CLI"
2023-05-16 10:47:31,641 INFO scripts.py:404 -- Running import path: 'hello:app_builder'.
2023-05-16 10:47:33,344 INFO worker.py:1615 -- Started a local Ray instance. View the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8265
(ServeController pid=56826) INFO 2023-05-16 10:47:35,115 controller 56826 deployment_state.py:1244 - Deploying new version of deployment default_HelloWorld.

(ServeReplica:default_HelloWorld pid=56830) Message: Hello from CLI
2023-05-16 10:47:36,131 SUCC scripts.py:424 -- Deployed Serve app successfully.


Notice that the “Hello from CLI” message is printed from within the deployment constructor.


Passing arguments via config file#
Pass arguments to the application builder in the config file’s args field:
applications:
  - name: MyApp
    import_path: hello:app_builder
    args:
      message: "Hello from config"


For example, to pass a new message to the HelloWorld app defined above (with the code saved in hello.py and the config saved in config.yaml):
% serve run config.yaml
2023-05-16 10:49:25,247 INFO scripts.py:351 -- Running config file: 'config.yaml'.
2023-05-16 10:49:26,949 INFO worker.py:1615 -- Started a local Ray instance. View the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8265
2023-05-16 10:49:28,678 SUCC scripts.py:419 -- Submitted deploy config successfully.
(ServeController pid=57109) INFO 2023-05-16 10:49:28,676 controller 57109 controller.py:559 - Building application 'MyApp'.
(ProxyActor pid=57111) INFO:     Started server process [57111]

(ServeReplica:MyApp_HelloWorld pid=57113) Message: Hello from config


Notice that the “Hello from config” message is printed from within the deployment constructor.


Typing arguments with Pydantic#
To avoid writing logic to parse and validate the arguments by hand, define a Pydantic model as the single input parameter’s type to your application builder function (the parameter must be type annotated).
Arguments are passed the same way, but the resulting dictionary is used to construct the Pydantic model using model.parse_obj(args_dict).
from pydantic import BaseModel

from ray import serve
from ray.serve import Application


class HelloWorldArgs(BaseModel):
    message: str


@serve.deployment
class HelloWorld:
    def __init__(self, message: str):
        self._message = message
        print("Message:", self._message)

    def __call__(self, request):
        return self._message


def typed_app_builder(args: HelloWorldArgs) -> Application:
    return HelloWorld.bind(args.message)




% serve run hello:app_builder message="Hello from CLI"
2023-05-16 10:47:31,641 INFO scripts.py:404 -- Running import path: 'hello:app_builder'.
2023-05-16 10:47:33,344 INFO worker.py:1615 -- Started a local Ray instance. View the dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8265
(ServeController pid=56826) INFO 2023-05-16 10:47:35,115 controller 56826 deployment_state.py:1244 - Deploying new version of deployment default_HelloWorld.
(ServeController pid=56826) INFO 2023-05-16 10:47:35,141 controller 56826 deployment_state.py:1483 - Adding 1 replica to deployment default_HelloWorld.
(ProxyActor pid=56828) INFO:     Started server process [56828]
(ServeReplica:default_HelloWorld pid=56830) Message: Hello from CLI
2023-05-16 10:47:36,131 SUCC scripts.py:424 -- Deployed Serve app successfully.





Common patterns#

Multiple parametrized applications using the same builder#
You can use application builders to run multiple applications with the same code but different parameters.
For example, multiple applications may share preprocessing and HTTP handling logic but use many different trained model weights.
The same application builder import_path can take different arguments to define multiple applications as follows:
applications:
  - name: Model1
    import_path: my_module:my_model_code
    args:
      model_uri: s3://my_bucket/model_1
  - name: Model2
    import_path: my_module:my_model_code
    args:
      model_uri: s3://my_bucket/model_2
  - name: Model3
    import_path: my_module:my_model_code
    args:
      model_uri: s3://my_bucket/model_3




Configuring multiple composed deployments#
You can use the arguments passed to an application builder to configure multiple deployments in a single application.
For example a model composition application might take weights to two different models as follows:
from pydantic import BaseModel

from ray.serve import Application


class ComposedArgs(BaseModel):
    model1_uri: str
    model2_uri: str


def composed_app_builder(args: ComposedArgs) -> Application:
    return IngressDeployment.bind(
        Model1.bind(args.model1_uri),
        Model2.bind(args.model2_uri),
    )
