class ray.rllib.offline.offline_prelearner.OfflinePreLearner(*, config: AlgorithmConfig, spaces: Tuple[gymnasium.Space, gymnasium.Space] | None = None, module_spec: MultiRLModuleSpec | None = None, module_state: Dict[str, Any] | None = None, **kwargs: Dict[str, Any])[source]#
Class that coordinates data transformation from dataset to learner.
This class is an essential part of the new Offline RL API of RLlib.
It is a callable class that is run in ray.data.Dataset.map_batches
when iterating over batches for training. It’s basic function is to
convert data in batch from rows to episodes (SingleAGentEpisode`s
for now) and to then run the learner connector pipeline to convert
further to trainable batches. These batches are used directly in the
`Learner’s update method.
The main reason to run these transformations inside of map_batches
is for better performance. Batches can be pre-fetched in ray.data
and therefore batch trransformation can be run highly parallelized to
the Learner''s `update.
This class can be overridden to implement custom logic for transforming
batches and make them ‘Learner’-ready. When deriving from this class
the __call__ method and _map_to_episodes can be overridden to induce
custom logic for the complete transformation pipeline (__call__) or
for converting to episodes only (‘_map_to_episodes`).
Custom OfflinePreLearner classes can be passed into
AlgorithmConfig.offline’s prelearner_class. The OfflineData class
will then use the custom class in its data pipeline.
PublicAPI (alpha): This API is in alpha and may change before becoming stable.
