Note
Ray 2.40 uses RLlib’s new API stack by default.
The Ray team has mostly completed transitioning algorithms, example scripts, and
documentation to the new code base.
If you’re still using the old API stack, see New API stack migration guide for details on how to migrate.


rllib.env.single_agent_env_runner.SingleAgentEnvRunner#


class ray.rllib.env.single_agent_env_runner.SingleAgentEnvRunner(*, config: AlgorithmConfig, **kwargs)[source]#
The generic environment runner for the single agent case.
PublicAPI (alpha): This API is in alpha and may change before becoming stable.


__init__(*, config: AlgorithmConfig, **kwargs)[source]#
Initializes a SingleAgentEnvRunner instance.

Parameters:
config – An AlgorithmConfig object containing all settings needed to
build this EnvRunner class.





sample(*, num_timesteps: int = None, num_episodes: int = None, explore: bool = None, random_actions: bool = False, force_reset: bool = False) → List[SingleAgentEpisode][source]#
Runs and returns a sample (n timesteps or m episodes) on the env(s).

Parameters:

num_timesteps – The number of timesteps to sample during this call.
Note that only one of num_timetseps or num_episodes may be provided.
num_episodes – The number of episodes to sample during this call.
Note that only one of num_timetseps or num_episodes may be provided.
explore – If True, will use the RLModule’s forward_exploration()
method to compute actions. If False, will use the RLModule’s
forward_inference() method. If None (default), will use the explore
boolean setting from self.config passed into this EnvRunner’s
constructor. You can change this setting in your config via
config.env_runners(explore=True|False).
random_actions – If True, actions will be sampled randomly (from the action
space of the environment). If False (default), actions or action
distribution parameters are computed by the RLModule.
force_reset – Whether to force-reset all (vector) environments before
sampling. Useful if you would like to collect a clean slate of new
episodes via this call. Note that when sampling n episodes
(num_episodes != None), this is fixed to True.


Returns:
A list of SingleAgentEpisode instances, carrying the sampled data.





get_metrics() → Dict[source]#
Returns metrics (in any form) of the thus far collected, completed episodes.

Returns:
Metrics of any form.





get_spaces()[source]#
Returns a dict mapping ModuleIDs to 2-tuples of obs- and action space.



make_env() → None[source]#
Creates a vectorized gymnasium env and stores it in self.env.
Note that users can change the EnvRunner’s config (e.g. change
self.config.env_config) and then call this method to create new environments
with the updated configuration.



make_module()[source]#
Creates the RLModule for this EnvRunner and assigns it to self.module.
Note that users should be able to change the EnvRunner’s config (e.g. change
self.config.rl_module_spec) and then call this method to create a new RLModule
with the updated configuration.
