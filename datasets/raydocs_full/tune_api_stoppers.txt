In addition to Trial Schedulers like ASHA, where a number of
trials are stopped if they perform subpar, Ray Tune also supports custom stopping mechanisms to stop trials early. They can also stop the entire experiment after a condition is met.
For instance, stopping mechanisms can specify to stop trials when they reached a plateau and the metric
doesnâ€™t change anymore.
Ray Tune comes with several stopping mechanisms out of the box. For custom stopping behavior, you can
inherit from the Stopper class.
Other stopping behaviors are described in the user guide.

Stopper Interface (tune.Stopper)#


Stopper
Base class for implementing a Tune experiment stopper.





Stopper.__call__
Returns true if the trial should be terminated given the result.

Stopper.stop_all
Returns true if the experiment should be terminated.





Tune Built-in Stoppers#


MaximumIterationStopper
Stop trials after reaching a maximum number of iterations

ExperimentPlateauStopper
Early stop the experiment when a metric plateaued across trials.

TrialPlateauStopper
Early stop single trials when they reached a plateau.

TimeoutStopper
Stops all trials after a certain timeout.

CombinedStopper
Combine several stoppers via 'OR'.

FunctionStopper
Provide a custom function to check if trial should be stopped.
